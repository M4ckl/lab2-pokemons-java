# lab2-pokemons-java

<strong>Task:</strong>
Based on the base class Pokemon, write your own classes for the specified types of Pokémon. Each type of Pokémon should have one or two types and the following standard base stats:

Health Points (HP)

Attack

Defense

Special Attack

Special Defense

Speed

The Pokémon classes should inherit according to the evolutionary chain of Pokémon. Based on the base classes PhysicalMove, SpecialMove, and StatusMove, implement your own classes for the specified types of attacks. All created classes without descendants should be implemented in such a way that inheritance from them is not allowed.

Each attack should have a standard type, power, and accuracy. Standard attack effects should be implemented. Assign each Pokémon type attacks according to the given variant. The Pokémon's level should be set to the minimum required for all implemented attacks.

Using the Battle class simulation, create 2 teams of Pokémon (each Pokémon should have a name) and run a battle.

The base classes and battle simulator are located in the provided jar archive (updated on 09.10.2018, fixed bug with adding attacks and encoding). Documentation is available in javadoc format here.
